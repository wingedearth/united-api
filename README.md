### Apollo Studio Sandbox

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive Apollo Studio sandbox at:
`http://localhost:4000/graphql`

The sandbox provides:
- Interactive query editor with syntax highlighting
- Schema exploration and documentation
- Query history and saved operations
- Real-time query execution and results

### GraphQL API

The server provides a comprehensive GraphQL API that integrates with the users-service. Here are some example queries:

#### Health Check (Public)
```graphql
query {
  health {
    status
    timestamp
    service
  }
}
```

#### Authentication (Public)
```graphql
# Register a new user
mutation {
  register(input: {
    email: "user@example.com"
    password: "securePassword123"
    firstName: "John"
    lastName: "Doe"
  }) {
    token
    user {
      id
      email
      firstName
      lastName
      role
    }
  }
}

# Login
mutation {
  login(input: {
    email: "user@example.com"
    password: "securePassword123"
  }) {
    token
    user {
      id
      email
      role
    }
  }
}
```

#### User Queries (Require Authentication)
```graphql
# Get current user
query {
  me {
    id
    email
    firstName
    lastName
    role
  }
}

# Get all users
query {
  users {
    id
    email
    firstName
    lastName
    role
  }
}
```

**Note**: For authenticated queries, include the JWT token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

See [examples/queries.graphql](./examples/queries.graphql) for more comprehensive examples.

## Users Service Integration

This GraphQL server acts as a gateway to the [users-service](https://github.com/wingedearth/users-service) REST API. 

### Configuration

Set the users-service URL in your `.env` file:
```bash
USERS_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Features

- **Authentication**: Register and login users via GraphQL mutations
- **User Management**: CRUD operations for users with proper authorization
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin-only operations for user promotion/demotion
- **Real-time Data**: Direct integration with users-service ensures data consistency
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful GraphQL error codes

### Authentication Flow

1. **Register/Login**: Use public mutations to get a JWT token
2. **Include Token**: Add `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to requests
3. **Access Protected Data**: Query user data and perform operations based on your role

### Prerequisites

Make sure the users-service is running before starting this GraphQL server:

```bash
# In your users-service directory
npm run dev
```

The users-service should be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured URL).

## Testing

## Releases and Changelog

This project uses [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to automatically generate changelogs and manage releases based on conventional commits.

### Creating a Release

```bash
# Automatically determine the next version based on commits
npm run release

# Force a specific release type
npm run release:patch  # 1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1
npm run release:minor  # 1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0
npm run release:major  # 1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0
```

### What happens during a release:

1. Analyzes commits since the last release
2. Determines the next version number
3. Updates `package.json` version
4. Generates/updates `CHANGELOG.md`
5. Creates a git tag
6. Commits the changes

### Changelog

The changelog is automatically generated from conventional commit messages. See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full project history.

## Conventional Commits
